          <p>Unfortunately, the work I’m contributing to Calcite has not been released. However, please feel free to email me with specific requests as to what you would like to learn about the projects I worked on, my processes and the deliverables. I would be happy to answer questions and share my experience.

          <h2 class="header2">Components</h2>
          <p>My first year with Calcite involved working as a UI/UX designer unifying component requirements that could best accommodate all of our teams that were motivated to use Calcite. The types of patterns that were created included filters, cards, rating systems, popovers and more. Each of it involved stimulating conversation amongst teams, research product needs and competitor research, and low to high fidelity designs.

            <h2 class="header2">Design kit</h2>
            <p>Although I still contribute in component patterns, my role has evolved to taking on as a Co-Project Manager on our design kit from our design system. It involves having a design kit for both internal and external usage, best practices for maintaining the system, and having systems in place for product and marketing. To prepare for this, conversations with our product manager and stakeholders were undertaken to create milestones and requirements for the team. This allows us to plan accordingly for the changes, so as not to reinvent the wheel every year.
