            <h2 class="header2">Summary</h2>
            <p>Within one sprint, I worked on extending utility to tools found within cards by enabling batch-editing with the same tools across multiple cards. This was more focused on the user experience side than user interface as the goal was to validate each tool to determine whether it made sense to allow users to perform batch work on that particular tool. While for some tools it made sense to create a batch version to expedite the users' workflow, other tools would have required too many extra steps to configure, hence reducing the overall return of having batch capabilities. The most important criteria was that the tool could be applied to several types of data cards, and also supported changes to data in real time if a map’s extent on the card was adjusted.
